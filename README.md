<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Home Screen][homescreen]]

The project represents an Python desktop app that uses the conventionnal neural network to help the user classify an image (in a category that we worked on) or to generate a random image.

### Built With

In this section we proccur a list of all major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap the project. 

* Python 5
* PyQT5
* PySide2

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To discover the project and to install and run the app you need to deal with some Prerequisites and installation :

### Prerequisites

To run the app some requirements are needed.In fact, some libraries that are used in the project are necessary to run the main program. 
That's why we gathered all the libraries inside a text file and the installation is done with only one line of code :
* pip
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Run the program

_Follow these quick steps to launch the desktop application_

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://forge.univ-lyon1.fr/p1714584/image-classification-and-generation.git
   ```
2. Install the prerequisites (Instalation is mentionned <a href="#prerequisites">here</a>)
 
3. Run Main.java

# Image Classification and Generation

## Presentation

Image Classification and Generation will represent a Desktop Application coded with Python and PyQt. The main role of this application is to classify by the help of an Artificial Intelligence, especially the deep learning an Image to a class or category.
The Image generation will be like the other process but this time the user will put a text and the App will generate the image corresponding to the text.
 
## Instructions

To launch the application all you need to do is to execute the main.py file.
The Application will present at first a loading screen and after that the main screen will be open and you will have to choose Classification or Generation :

### Classification :

When you click the "Classification" button it will redirect you to a screen with multiple choices for example : animals , plant , ... and you will choose the group of classification that you need and after that you upload your image and it will tell you what it represents.

### Generation : 

If you clicked on the "Generation" button you will be redirected on a page where you can type a text and an image will be generated depending on your text.
